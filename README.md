## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

This will only be APIs so post man will be the best way to run this.


### `npm run dev`

Runs the node application in develop mode AND the React application concurrently.
- Server Side [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- UI Side [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Node server will start first, once you see that server is running and Mongo DB is connected, then 
a browser will open up displaying the UI.


## Mongo Setup

This application is running on MLabs mongo database.  It's a free online db for development purposes.
